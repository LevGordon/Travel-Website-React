# About this project:

I followed along a youtube tutorial and copied what he did. Although I am familiar with most of the code, the implementation and the creative aspects made it an interesting learning process whilst simultaneously solidifying already existing knowledge. I am also self-aware enough that copy-pasting code will not make me a great developer, thus I decided to CONTINUE working on this website and FINISH the existing skeleton. 

This is an oxymoronic challenge in the sense that it requires creativity whilst also following creative constraints of another individual's view. This is something a face a lot being in a rock band that strives to follow full democracy amongst the members. But one thing is certain - discomfort = growth and creative limitations mend you for the better.


ALL OF MY COMMITS PRIOR TO SEPTEMBER 3RD 2022 ARE A COPY OF THE VIDEO CODE. EVERYTHING AFTER ARE MY OWN ADDITIONS.
